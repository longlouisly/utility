looks like matlab couldn't find GLIBCXX 3.4.20 from /usr/lib64 or matlab/r2014b/sys/os/... .../libstdc++.s0.6
To check, use:

strings /opt/apps/ossw/applications/gcc/gcc-5.2/c7/lib64/libstdc++.so.6 |grep GLIBCXX

now this one does have the proper GLIB version. use
LD_PRELOAD="/opt/apps/ossw/applications/gcc/gcc-5.2/c7/lib64/libstdc++.so.6" matlab




other considerations:
Zimo says to use Jan 27th revision, since the latest Feb does not include visualize_output_masks.
Also, remove parfors, they're buggy for some reason. Could be related to GLIBCXX? Check later.
Remove hard coded paths containing Zimo.
