# From Noah

# use a password to encrypt file
# the symmetric is important, otherwise you'd have to store the keys
# the armor option writes the files in ascii
gpg --armor --symmetric file

# to decrypt
gpg file.gpg


# For cloud storage, noah suggests store the files online encrypted using keys. 
# Then encrypt the keys with symmetric encryption password.


# Alternatively, it looks like rclone can encrypt using password just fine, even though the hashed passwords look different.
