anaconda has patch_elf utility to change the rpath
(this tells the library where to find libraries at runtime, without relying on env variables.)
(This is useful when many versions of library exist on a system)
there is another utility called chrpath, but it is restricted to rpaths of the same length as the original rpath! this is useless!
