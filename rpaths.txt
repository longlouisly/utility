anaconda has patch_elf utility to change the rpath
(this tells the library where to find libraries at runtime, without relying on env variables.)
patchelf --print-rpath library.so
patchelf --set-rpath [rpath] library.so

(This is useful when many versions of library exist on a system)
there is another utility called chrpath, but it is restricted to rpaths of the same length as the original rpath! this is useless!
