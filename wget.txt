For downloading files from a directory listing, use -r (recursive), -np (don't follow links to parent directories), and -k to make links in downloaded HTML or CSS point to local files (credit @xaccrocheur).

wget -r -np -k http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs468-10-fall/schedule/schedule.html 

Other useful options:

    -nd (no directories): download all files to the current directory
    -e robots.off: ignore robots.txt files, don't download robots.txt files
    -A png,jpg: accept only files with the extensions png or jpg
    -m (mirror): -r --timestamping --level inf --no-remove-listing
    -nc, --no-clobber: Skip download if files exist
